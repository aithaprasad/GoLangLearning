Welcome back to the continuous learning of Go Language !!

Let's continue from **Slices**.

If you remember we discussed on Slices still have the reference to it's original array. Basically, it means that all changes on the slice array are gonna reflect on the original array.

For more clarification, let's see how we can make a slice and what happens to parent array when we modify an element in the slice? 

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	example := [4]string{
		"We",
		"are not",
		"learning",
		"Go",
	}
	fmt.Println(example) //[We are not learning Go]

	a := example[0:2]
	b := example[1:3]
	fmt.Println(a, b) // [We are not] [are not learning]

	b[0] = "are"
	fmt.Println(a, b) // [We are] [are learning]
	fmt.Println(example) // [We are learning Go]
}
```

In the above code snippet, when we change the element of the 'b' slice, it even got reflected in original **example** array.

A slice has two properties **length** and **capacity**.

**Length** is similar to size of an array that states how many number of elements are present in the array, which we generally see in many programming languages.  

**Capacity of a slice** means number of elements in the underlying array, **counting from the first element** in the slice.

For length, we use ```len(arr_name)```
For capacity, we use ```cap(s)```

We will see an example and that gives you more practical understanding on the length and capacity part.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := []int{11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21}
	fmt.Println(s, len(s), cap(s)) // [11 13 15 17 19 21] 6 6

	s = s[:0]
	fmt.Println(s, len(s), cap(s)) // [] 0 6

	s = s[:4]
	fmt.Println(s, len(s), cap(s)) // [11 13 15 17] 4 6

	s = s[2:]
	fmt.Println(s, len(s), cap(s)) // [15 17] 2 4 
	
	s = s[0:4]
	fmt.Println(s, len(s), cap(s)) // [15 17 19 21] 4 4
}

```
I attached output statements beside the print statements respectively in the snippet that gives more understanding on **length** and **capacity**.

We always should have a glance on zero value of each datatype. For example, an int has zero, string has '' and boolean has False. Similarly, the zero value of a slice is nil.
Both length and capacity are zero and it does not have any parent/original/underlying array assosciated with it.

There is another way to create dynamically sized arrays with the help of builtin **make** function. It takes in three parameters that define what type of
elements you want to be in the array, length of the array and capcity of the array. Capacity is an optional parameter.

In terms of code, just do
```
arr := make([]int, 0, 5) // len(b)=0, cap(b)=5
```

And then similar to 2D arrays, we can make slices within slices. 

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	// Create a tic-tac-toe board.
	board := [][]int{
		[]int{1, 2, 3},
		[]int{4, 5, 6},
		[]int{7, 8, 9},
	}
}
```

You might have heard of append function whose duty is to append an element to the list/array.
