Welcome back to the continuous learning of Go Language !!

Let's continue from **Slices**.

If you remember we discussed on Slices still have the reference to it's original array. Basically, it means that all changes on the slice array are gonna reflect on the original array.

For more clarification, let's see how we can make a slice and what happens to parent array when we modify an element in the slice? 

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	example := [4]string{
		"We",
		"are not",
		"learning",
		"Go",
	}
	fmt.Println(example) //[We are not learning Go]

	a := example[0:2]
	b := example[1:3]
	fmt.Println(a, b) // [We are not] [are not learning]

	b[0] = "are"
	fmt.Println(a, b) // [We are] [are learning]
	fmt.Println(example) // [We are learning Go]
}
```

In the above code snippet, when we change the element of the 'b' slice, it even got reflected in original **example** array.

A slice has two properties **length** and **capacity**.

**Length** is similar to size of an array that states how many number of elements are present in the array, which we generally see in many programming languages.  

**Capacity of a slice** means number of elements in the underlying array, **counting from the first element** in the slice.

For length, we use ```len(arr_name)```
For capacity, we use ```cap(s)```

We will see an example and that gives you more practical understanding on the length and capacity part.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := []int{11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21}
	fmt.Println(s, len(s), cap(s)) // [11 13 15 17 19 21] 6 6

	s = s[:0]
	fmt.Println(s, len(s), cap(s)) // [] 0 6

	s = s[:4]
	fmt.Println(s, len(s), cap(s)) // [11 13 15 17] 4 6

	s = s[2:]
	fmt.Println(s, len(s), cap(s)) // [15 17] 2 4 
	
	s = s[0:4]
	fmt.Println(s, len(s), cap(s)) // [15 17 19 21] 4 4
}

```
I attached output statements beside the print statements respectively in the snippet that gives more understanding on **length** and **capacity**.
