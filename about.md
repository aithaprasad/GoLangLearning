title: Which language and Why?
---
I will be learning the "Go" Language this semester.

I feel that "Go" is one of the currently booming backend languages because of its ease to use and I found out(from my research) that it's simple and easy to create micro-services and manage and maintain them.

When I browsed through LinkedIn, I got to know that there are many start-ups that are using Go as their backend language. As my near future goal is to become a Full Stack Developer with 60% of work as Backend Developer. So, I feel this language can open the door for me to be a GoLang Developer.
