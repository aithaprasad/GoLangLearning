Welcome back to the GoLang Learning Blog. 

This week we are going to look at the topic which I was afraid of till date. And that's one of the reason which made me not to touch C++ in my entire life.
You might have guessed the topic, if not let me reveal it....... Its's The **POINTERS**.

Learning Pointers was the biggest challenge for me from my first day of coding. I had gone through various examples and cleared many exercises this week to
understand Pointer's in GoLang. If you are the same person, who hates pointers then get some patience and be with me till the blog ends and I promise that you
are going to love the pointers in the end. This week with the help from Go Play ground and with many examples and exercises from internet I turned my most
challenging topic to my one of the favorite topics in Software World. Hope, you too change after going through this blog.

**Firstly, Whats a pointer or What does it do in the programming world?**

From the name pointer itself you might have understood that pointer is a item which points to something. I am not sure if every language has Pointr concept.
Anyways, Go has pointers and it points to the value at specified addres. It just holds the memory address where the value is resided.

The type \*T is a pointer to a T value. Its zero value is nil.
Let's say if we want to create a variable named 'p' with type int in Go lang. Then just use ```var p *int```.

Then let's say if we want to assosciate this pointer to any address which has already value resided in it then use ```p = &name_of_the_variable```. 
The & operator generates a pointer to its operand. If we had a ```random_var := 1``` and want pointer p to point here. The just use ```p = &random_var```.

The \* operator denotes the pointer's underlying value. 

And then you have a term called **dereferencing** which means if you want to change the value of random_var which we created above through the pointer, then just do 
```*p = 2```.

That simple it is. Let's dive in more now.

Let's understand another term or data structure called **Structs**.

A struct is a collection of fields. You can utilize struct when you already know the structure of the field. If you want to create an array with each index having a 
defined pair of two integers, then ywe can utilize struct. Don't think if how to create arrays now, I will help you to create and initialize them in next steps.

To create a struct with name int_pair, we do 

```
type intpair struct {
  X int
  Y int
}
``` 

and if we need to return or print it, then do ```fmt.Println(intpair{1, 1})``` .
